# Office Network Design & Configuration

## Description
Designed and implemented a small-scale office network using Cisco Packet Tracer with VLAN configuration, IP subnetting, and inter-VLAN routing.
The network is structured to handle multiple departments with efficient IP allocation and seamless communication between VLANs.

## Features
Department-wise VLAN Setup: Created VLANs for 3 departments ‚Äî Admin, Sales, and IT ‚Äî ensuring network segmentation and security.

Efficient IP Allocation: Assigned IP addresses using subnetting for optimal utilization of network resources.

Inter-VLAN Communication: Configured routers and switches for smooth communication between VLANs.

Connectivity Testing: Verified network stability and device reachability using ping tests.

## Tools Used
-Cisco Packet Tracer (Network simulation and design)

## Steps to Run
Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer.

Open the .pkt file included in the repository.

Explore VLAN configurations, IP addressing, and router setup.

Run ping tests between devices from different VLANs to verify connectivity.

## Future Improvements

Implement network security policies (ACLs, firewalls).

Add redundancy using multiple switches and routers.

Configure DHCP server for automatic IP allocation.

## Output Example
- Successful pings between VLANs after router-on-a-stick configuration.
